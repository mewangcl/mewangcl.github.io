<LI>MedTech Award by "Multi-Axis Robot-Based Bioprinting System Supporting Natural Cell Function Preservation and Cardiac Tissue Fabrication", 3D Pioneers Challenge, 2022
<!-----------
Jury says:
"This development convinced the jury with the combination of different advanced technologies that can map cells in complex structures in a vector-based and thus sustainable functional way. With the use of several robotic arms, different tissues can be combined with each other in the future and thus complex tissues, organs and limbs can be printed. For the jury, this is a milestone in medical technology." 

3D Pioneers Challenge (https://3dpc.io/en)
The international design competition for Additive Manufacturing processes and Advanced Technologies is the most prestigious award of its kind and is one of the most highly endowed worldwide. The annual announcement and presentation of the finalists is considered to be the innovation monitor of the industry. Unique in its structure, the competition has been addressing specialists who think outside the box since 2015 - pushing boundaries!
