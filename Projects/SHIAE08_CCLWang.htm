<p class=MsoNormal><b>Abstract:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>In the clothing industry,
compression garments are increasingly being used to mould and confine the
malleable shape of the human body. The garment design may require variation in
pressure ranging from normal through increased strain in specific areas for the
particular application. Therefore compression garments need to be customized
because body shapes differ and require different strain distribution. The 3D
body shape can be obtained by any popular 3D data-acquisition means (e.g., a
human body laser scanner). However, it is the 2D pattern C fabricated into the
3D shape combined with the fabric parameters, which brings about the desired
strain distribution C that has to be determined. At present, the 2D pattern
design and garment-to-body fit is accomplished through trial-and-error. This
subjective procedure is inefficient, inaccurate and costly, as many prototypes
have to be produced. Therefore, a computer program is desirable that can
automatically generate 2D patterns from an input of the 3D shape that, when
fabricated into the final 3D garment, the 2D pattern profiles give the designed
strain and pressure on the human body. In this research we propose to develop
techniques to compute 2D meshes that can generate a user-defined strain
distribution through proper distortion, when folded onto the 3D body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Project Objectives:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop a new physical/geometric approach
that is able to model complicated elastic behaviors of fabrics, and determine
the 2D patterns of a given 3D mesh surface satisfying the given strain and/or
normal pressure distribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigate numerical schemes to compute
optimal 2D patterns efficiently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop a test-bed to evaluate the
material-related coefficients in the developed physical/geometric model and
verify the simulation results according to experimental tests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Background of Research:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the clothing industry, compression garment is employed to
plastic the shape of a human body so that certain specified strain (or
compression) can be obtained at some designated places on the body (see Figure
1-3). The 3D body shape can be obtained by any 3D popular data-acquisition
means (e.g., a human body laser scanner, see [1] and [2]). However, no method
has been successfully investigated to compute the 2D patterns for compression
(or performance) garments by a computer program automatically. This motivates
the work proposed in this project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In computer graphics, the pioneer work of Terzopoulos et al.
[3] provided a general physically-based modeling method for elastic objects,
which employs the finite-element and the finite-difference methods to solve the
dynamic governing equations that simulate the deformation of objects like
cloth, rubber, metal, etc. Following that work, much effort has been given to
improving the simulation of cloth, either in verisimilitude or efficiency
aspects [4-8]. In all of these works, however, the input is a planar pattern
(tessellated), and their common purpose is to simulate/predict the
three-dimensional shape and motion under some physical theorem. The problem to
solve in this research is the inverse C given a 3D shape and certain associated
required physical properties (e.g., strain or pressure), how to determine the 2D
patterns that can generate such physical properties. No above existing
approaches can be directly applied here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another sort of research in literature related to our work
is mesh parameterization and surface flattening. Similar to our work here, the
parameterization of a given 3D mesh surface concerns with finding the
corresponding 2D parametric domain via surface flattening. In general, a
surface parameterization inevitably introduces distortion in either angle or
area. All the known parameterization methods are based on how to minimize the
distortions (see [9] for a detailed review). Among the abundant literature of
mesh parameterization, only a few schemes (e.g., [10-12]) generate a planar
domain with a free boundary so that it can be employed to compute the shape of
2D patterns. However, they never addressed the problem of how to satisfy
certain given strain and compression in the 3D shape fabricated from the
computed 2D patterns. In the realm of computer-aided design, the surface
flattening for pattern design has been studied from various perspectives (cf.
[13-15]). Nevertheless, neither mesh parameterization nor mesh flattening
approaches provides a solution to the physical/geometric problem posed in this
research.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recently, in [16], a woven-model based geometric approach is
proposed for the design of elastic medical braces, where the elastic brace worn
by a human body is simulated by a woven model with orthogonal warp and weft
threads. In that work, the elastic behavior is simulated by three types of
springs: warp, weft and diagonal. An elastic energy is formulated with these
springs, and a diffusion process is adopted to minimize the elastic energy that
determines the distribution of woven nodes on the given 3D surface, so to
obtain the desired 3D-to-2D mapping. There are however serious deficiencies in
the approach of [16]:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:宋体'>&#8226;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Only the elasticity in two directions C warp and weft C is considered;
therefore, when in equilibrium, the strain (and stress) on a single weft or
warp thread is a constant. The result is that only very simple patterns of
strain distribution can be simulated by the woven model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:宋体'>&#8226;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The computation of re-distributing the woven nodes on the surface is based on
the knowledge of a strain distribution. However, computing such strain
distribution in general is not straightforward. And thus again, the woven-model
based approach in [16] can only mimic very simple and limited patterns of
strain distribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:宋体'>&#8226;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The strains on the springs around a point with a user specified normal pressure
is calculated by fitting a quadratic polynomial. Such an approximation is not
accurate enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:宋体'>&#8226;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The boundary of the woven model takes a zigzag-like shape, which brings great
difficulty in modeling the physical interactions between the 2D pieces that
will have to be sewed together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-family:宋体'>&#8226;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is no guarantee that all the threads will be in the tensile state, which
though is strongly required by a compression garment.</p>
