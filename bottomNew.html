Dr. Charlie C. L. Wang is currently Professor and Chair in Smart Manufacturing at the University of Manchester (UoM). Before joining UoM in 2020, he worked as a Professor and Chair of Advanced Manufacturing at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands (2016) and as a Professor (2015) / Associate Professor (2009) / Assistant Professor (2003) of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
He also held a visiting professor position at University of Southern California in 2011 for his sabbatical leave. He received his B.Eng. degree (1998) in mechatronics engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and his Ph.D. degree (2002) in mechanical engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Prof. Wang has received numerous honors, including the ASME CIE Excellence in Research Award (2016), the ASME CIE Young Engineer Award (2009), nine Best Paper Awards, five project-oriented awards, and three teaching awards. He was elected as a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 2013, and he currently holds an EPSRC Fellowship on Field Computation Based Kernel for Vector 3D Printing (2023-2028).
