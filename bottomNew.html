Professor Charlie C.L. Wang is internationally recognized for his research in geometry-driven intelligence for design and manufacturing, where he has established geometric computing and optimization as foundational mechanisms for intelligent engineering solutions. His work has transformed the integration of design, analysis, and fabrication by embedding manufacturability, material behaviour, and process constraints directly into geometric design variables, enabling adaptive, high-performance manufacturing systems across additive and hybrid processes. He is currently Professor as Chair in Smart Manufacturing at the University of Manchester (UoM) holding an EPSRC Fellowship (2023-2028) on Field Computation Based Kernel for Vector 3D Printing. Before joining UoM in 2020, he worked as Professor and Chair of Advanced Manufacturing at Delft University of Technology and as Professor of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Prof. Wang has received numerous recognitions, including the ASME CIE Excellence in Research Award (2016), ten Best Paper Awards, five project-oriented awards, and three teaching awards. He is Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the Solid Modelling Association (SMA).
