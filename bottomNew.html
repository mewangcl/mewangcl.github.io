Dr. Charlie C. L. Wang is currently Professor of Smart Manufacturing at the University of Manchester (UoM) holding an EPSRC Fellowship on Field Computation Based Kernel for Vector 3D Printing. Before joining UoM in 2020, he worked as Professor and Chair of Advanced Manufacturing at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands and as Professor of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He received his B.Eng. degree (1998) in mechatronics engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and his Ph.D. degree (2002) in mechanical engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Prof. Wang has received numerous honors, including the ASME CIE Excellence in Research Award (2016), the ASME CIE Young Engineer Award (2009), nine Best Paper Awards, five project-oriented awards, and three teaching awards. He worked as the chair of Solid Modeling Association from 2021 to 2024, and was elected a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 2013 based on his contribution to computer-aided product and process development.
