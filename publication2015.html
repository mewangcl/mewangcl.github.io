<B>Abstract</B>
<BR>
We present the first method to animate sheets of paper at interactive rates, while automatically generating a plausible set of sharp features when the
sheet is crumpled. The key idea is to interleave standard physically-based simulation steps with procedural generation of a piecewise continuous developable
surface. The resulting hybrid surface model captures new singular points dynamically appearing during the crumpling process, mimicking
the effect of paper fiber fracture. Although the model evolves over time to take these irreversible damages into account, the mesh used for simulation
is kept coarse throughout the animation, leading to efficient computations. Meanwhile, the geometric layer ensures that the surface stays almost isometric
to its original 2D pattern. We validate our model through measurements and visual comparison with real paper manipulation, and show results
on a variety of crumpled paper configurations.

<BR>
This paper introduces a perceptual model for determining 3D printing orientations. Additive manufacturing methods involving low-cost 3D printers often require robust branching support structures to prevent material collapse at overhangs. Although the designed shape can successfully be made by adding supports, residual material remains at the contact points after the supports have been removed, resulting in unsightly surface artifacts. Moreover, fine surface details on the fabricated model can easily be damaged while removing supports. To prevent the visual impact of these artifacts, we present a method to find printing directions that avoid placing supports in perceptually significant regions. Our model for preference in 3D printing direction is formulated as a combination of metrics including area of support, visual saliency, preferred viewpoint and smoothness preservation. We develop a training-and-learning methodology to obtain a closed-form solution for our perceptual model and perform a large-scale study. We demonstrate the performance of this perceptual model on both natural and man-made objects.

<BR>
A self-folding structure fabricated by additive manufacturing can be automatically folded into a demanding 3D 
shape by actuation mechanisms such as heating. However, 3D surfaces can only be fabricated by self-folding structures 
when they are flattenable. Most generally designed parts are not flattenable. To address the problem, we 
develop a shape optimization method to modify a non-flattenable surface into flattenable. The shape optimization 
framework is equipped with topological operators for adding interior/boundary cuts to further improve the flattenability. 
When inserting cuts, self-intersection is locally prevented on the flattened 2D pieces. The total length of 
inserted cuts is also minimized to reduce artifacts on the finally folded 3D shape.

<B>Abstract</B>
<BR>
In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-effective method for isotropic meshing relying on Euclidean distance transformation based centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT). Our approach improves the performance and robustness of computing CVT on curved domains while simultaneously providing high-quality output meshes. While conventional extrinsic methods compute CVTs in the entire volume bounded by the input model, we restrict the computation to a 3D shell of user-controlled thickness. Taking voxels which contain surface samples as sites, we compute the exact Euclidean distance transform on the GPU. Our algorithm is parallel and memory-efficient, and can construct the shell space for resolutions up to 20483 at interactive speed. The 3D centroidal Voronoi tessellation and restricted Voronoi diagrams are also computed efficiently on the GPU. Since the shell space can bridge holes and gaps smaller than a certain tolerance, and tolerate non-manifold edges and degenerate triangles, our algorithm can handle models with such defects, which typically cause conventional remeshing methods to fail. Our method can process implicit surfaces, polyhedral surfaces, and point clouds in a unified framework. Computational results show that our GPU-based isotropic meshing algorithm produces results comparable to state-of- the-art techniques, but is significantly faster than conventional CPU-based implementations.

<B>Abstract</B>
<BR>
Keeping a constant cutting force in CNC machining is very important for obtaining better stability of cutting operation and improving topography, texture and geometry of the machined surface. This paper presents a feed-rate optimization approach based on <I>Material Removal Rate</I> (MRR). Given a tool-path with predefined feed-rates, the geometry of raw material, and the shape of cutter, the histogram of MRR in very fine resolution can be efficiently computed by using a GPU-based geometric modeling kernel. Starting from the evaluation given on the finest histogram of MRR, error-controlled subdivision algorithms are developed to progressively segment the tool-path into user-specified number of sub-regions. Different feed-rates are assigned to different sub-regions so that nearly constant MRR can be achieved while keeping the shape of the given tool-path unchanged. Experimental tests taken on real examples verify the effectiveness of this method.

<BR>
To reduce the usage of supporting structure in additive manufacturing, an orientation-driven shape optimizer was developed in our prior work [Hu et al. 2015] which employs a volumetric mesh enclosing the input 3D models as the domain of computation. The orientation of a model is computed indirectly by surface of the volumetric mesh. In this paper, we extend our indirect computation to an approach that the computation is directly based on the information of input models by an algorithm using incremental linear programming and K-means clustering. The performance of this approach is decoupled from the shape similarity between the volumetric mesh and the input model. As a result, representations obtained from simpler volumetric decomposition such as voxels can be adopted as the domain of computation.

<B>Abstract</B>
<BR>
In layer-based additive manufacturing (AM), supporting structures need to be inserted to support the overhanging
regions. The adding of supporting structures slows down the speed of fabrication and introduces artifacts onto the
finished surface. We present an orientation-driven shape optimizer to slim down the supporting structures used in
single material-based AM. The optimizer can be employed as a tool to help designers to optimize the original model to
achieve a more self-supported shape, which can be used as a reference for their further design. The model to be
optimized is first enclosed in a volumetric mesh, which is employed as the domain of computation. The optimizer is
driven by the operations of reorientation taken on tetrahedra with `facing-down' surface facets. We formulate the
demand on minimizing shape variation as global rigidity energy. The local optimization problem for determining a
minimal rotation is analyzed on the Gauss sphere, which leads to a closed-form solution. Moreover, we also extend our
approach to create the functions of controlling the deformation and searching for optimal printing directions.

To solve the problem of generating segmentations of meaningful
parts from scanned models with freeform surfaces, we explore a
compact shape prior based segmentation approach in this paper. Our
approach is inspired by an observation that a variety of natural
objects consist of meaningful components in the form of compact
shape and these components with compact shape are usually
separated with each other by salient features. The segmentation
for multi-regions is performed in two phases in our framework.
Firstly, the segmentation is taken in low-level with the help of
discrete Morse complex enhanced by anisotropic filtering.
Secondly, we extract components with compact shape by using
agglomerative clustering to optimize the normalized cut metric, in
which the affinities of boundary compatibility, 2D shape
compactness and 3D shape compactness are incorporated. The
practical functionality of our approach is proved by applying it
to the application of customized dental treatment.

We tackle the problem of photometric stereo under near point lighting in this paper. Different from the conventional formulation of photometric stereo that
assumes parallel lighting, photometric stereo under the near point lighting condition is a nonlinear problem as the local surface normals are coupled with its
distance to the camera as well as the light sources. To solve this non-linear problem of PS with near point lighting, a local/global mesh deformation approach
is developed in our work to determine the position and the orientation of a facet simultaneously, where each facet is corresponding to a pixel in the image
captured by the camera. Unlike nonlinear optimization schemes, the mesh deformation in our approach is decoupled into an iteration of interlaced steps of local
projection and global blending. Experimental results verify that our method can generate accurate estimation of surface shape under near point lighting in a
few iterations. Besides, this approach is robust to errors on the positions of light sources and is easy to be implemented.

Designing cooling channels for the thermoplastic injection process
is a very important step in mold design. A conformal cooling
channel can significantly improve the efficiency and the quality
of production in plastic injection molding. This paper introduces
an approach to generate spiral channels for conformal cooling. The
cooling channels designed by our algorithms has very simple
connectivity and can achieve effective conformal cooling for the
models with complex shapes. The axial curves of cooling channels
are constructed on a free-form surface conformal to the mold
surface. With the help of boundary-distance maps, algorithms are
investigated to generate evenly distributed spiral curves on the
surface. The cooling channels derived from these spiral curves are
conformal to the plastic part and introduce nearly no reduction at
the rate of coolant flow. Therefore, the channels are able to
achieve uniform mold cooling. Moreover, by having simple
connectivity, these spiral channels can be fabricated by copper
duct bending instead of expensive selective laser sintering.

This paper presents a framework to compute stable contact
interfaces for automatically designing customized jigs used in
bone surgeries. Given the surface model of a bone represented by
polygonal meshes, we find out a small region on the surface to be
used as the interface of a customized jig so that it can be stably
fixed on the bone under a directional clamping force. The
variation of directions on the clamping force is allowed in our
formulation. Moreover, the surface region serves as the interface
of stable contact must also be disassemblable so that the jig and
the bone can be separated after removing the clamping force. The
analysis of stable contact is formulated on a Gaussian map by the
common regions of half-spaces according to the motion
restrictions. A flooding algorithm is proposed to determine those
disassemblable and stable contact interfaces on the surface of a
bone, where the contact surfaces are later converted into the
solid model of a jig to be fabricated by additive manufacturing.
Experimental tests are taken to verify the stable contact between
a bone and the jig generated by our approach.

In this paper, we present a low-cost IMU-based
system, Pedalvatar, which can capture the full-body motion of
users in real-time. Unlike the prior approaches using the hip-joint
as the root of forward kinematic model, a foot-rooted
kinematic model is developed in this work. A state change
mechanism has also been investigated to allow dynamically
switching the root of kinematic trees between the left and
the right foot. Benefitted from this, full-body motions can be
well captured in our system as long as there is at least one
static foot in the movement. The 'floating' artifact of hip-joint
rooted methods has been eliminated in our approach,
and more complicated motions such as climbing stairs can be
successfully captured in real-time. Comparing to those vision based
systems, this IMU-based system provides more flexibility
on capturing outdoor motions that are important for many
robotic applications.

<BR>
In this paper, we propose an efficient method to reconstruct
 surface-from-gradients (SfG). 
Our method is formulated under the
framework of discrete geometry processing. Unlike the existing SfG
 approaches, we transfer the continuous reconstruction problem into
a discrete space and efficiently solve the problem via a sequence

of least-square optimization steps. Our discrete formulation
brings three advantages: 1) the reconstruction preserves
sharp-features, 2) sparse/incomplete set of gradients can be well
 handled, 
and 3) domains of computation can have irregular
 boundaries. Generally, these strengths of our method help overcome 
the unwanted distortions during the surface reconstruction. Our
 formulation is direct and easy to implement, 
and the comparisons 
with state-of-the-arts show the effectiveness of our method.

<BR>
In this paper, we present a method for reconstructing
3D human body from incomplete data, which are point clouds
captured by inexpensive RGB-D cameras. Making use of the
volumetric mesh in a template, the fitting process is robust. This
method produces high quality fitting results on incomplete data,
which are hard to be offered by the surface fitting based methods.
The method is formulated as an optimization procedure, so that
the results of volumetric fitting rely on the quality of initial
shape (i.e., the shape of template). In order to find a good initial
shape, we develop a template selection algorithm to choose a
template in an iterative manner by using the statistical models
of human bodies. Experimental results show that our method
can successfully reconstruct human body with less than 1%
anthropometry measurement error.

<B>Abstract</B>
<BR>
In this paper, we present an optimization framework for automating
the shape customization of human-centric products, 
which can be
mounted on or embedded in human body (such as exoskeletal devices
and implants). This kind of products needs to be customized to fit
the body shapes of users. 
At present, the design customization for
freeform objects is often taken in an interactive manner that is
inefficient. We investigate a method to automate the procedure of
customization. 
Major difficulty in solving this problem is caused
by the not freely changed shape of components. They should be
selected from a series of standardized shapes. 
Different from the
existing approaches that allow fabricating all components by
customized production, we develop a new method to generate
customized products by 
using as-many-as-possible standardized
components. Our work is based on a mixed-integer shape
optimization framework.

<B>Abstract</B>
<BR>
Ruled surfaces play an important role in many manufacturing and
construction applications. 
In this work, we explore a
 multi-dimensional dynamic programming based ruled surface fitting
s cheme to a given freeform rational surface, <I>S</I>.  
Considering two
initial opposite boundaries of <I>S</I>, sampled into a discrete
 piecewise linear polyline representation, 
the ruled surface
fitting problem is reduced to a pairing-search between the
 polylines and elevations above the polylines, 
in the normal 
directions of <I>S</I>. 
A four-dimensional dynamic programming
 solution is sought for the four dimensions prescribed by the two

polylines and the two elevation levels along the surface normals.

This multi-dimensional dynamic programming is evaluated using

highly parallel algorithms running on GPUs that ensures the best

fit to the sampled data. In order to evaluate the fitting error
 with respect to <I>S</I>, we derive a scheme to compute a bound from
 
above on the maximal error between a bilinear surface patch
 (formed by two consecutive point-pairs) and its corresponding
 
surface region on <I>S</I>. Surface-surface composition is employed to
 extract the corresponding surface region on <I>S</I> to compare
 against. 
Finally, the above ruled surface fitting approach is also
 extended into a discrete algorithm to find the non-isoparametric 

subdivision curve on <I>S</I> when a discrete recursive piecewise-ruled
 surface fitting is considered.  
A five- or seven-dimensional
 dynamic programming solution is employed toward this end and once
 again, 
surface-surface composition is employed to extract the two 
subdivided patches as tensor products.

<B>Abstract</B>
<BR>
Techniques have been developed to deform a mesh with multiple types of constraints. 
One limitation of prior methods is that the accuracy of demanded metrics on the resultant 
model cannot be guaranteed. Adding metrics directly as hard constraints to an optimization 
functional often leads to unexpected distortion when target metrics differ significant from 
what are on the input model. In this paper, we present an effective framework to deform mesh 
models by enforcing demanded metrics on length, area and volume. To approach target metrics 
stably and minimize distortion,an iterative scale-driven deformation is investigated, and a 
global optimization functional is exploited to balance the scaling effect at different parts of a model. 
Examples demonstrate that our approach provides a user-friendly tool for designers who are used to semantic input.

<B>Abstract</B>
<BR>
This article presents highly parallel algorithms for remeshing polygonal models guided by cues from human visual perception. 
The remeshing framework is based on meshfree techniques for processing surface sample points. 
The benefit is twofold: it is robust to input models with problematic connectivity and the geometric processing on points is easier to run in parallel on GPUs. 
The visual perception information is extracted in the image space and then mapped back to the Euclidean space. 
Based on these cues, a saliency field is generated to re-sample the input model. 
Lastly, a new projection operator is developed to further optimize the distribution of re-sampled points. 
As the number of vertices on the resultant model is controlled by the down-sampled points, this remeshing framework can also be used in model simplification. 
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can remesh diverse polygonal models to well-shaped triangular meshes with high visual fidelity.

<B>Abstract</B><BR>Given an intersection-free mesh surface S, we introduce a method to thicken S into a solid H located at one side of S. By such a surface-to-solid conversion operation, industrial users are able to fabricate a designed (or reconstructed) surface by rapid prototyping. In this paper, we first investigate an implicit representation of the thickened solid H according to an extension of signed distance function. After that, a partial surface reconstruction algorithm is proposed to generate the boundary surface of H, which remains the given surface S on the resultant surface. Experimental tests show that the thickening results generated by our method give nearly uniform thickness and meanwhile do not present shape approximation error at the region of input surface S. These two good properties are important to the industria applications of solid fabrication.<p></p></tr></table><BR><BR>

<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B><BR>Recent development of per-frame motion extraction method can generate the skeleton of human motion in real-time with the help of RGB-D cameras such as Kinect. This leads to an economic device to provide human motion as input for real-time applications. As generated by a single-view image plus depth information, the extracted skeleton usually has problems of unwanted vibration, bone-length variation, self-occlusion, etc. This paper presents an approach to overcome these problems by synthesizing the skeletons generated by duplex Kinects, which capture the human motion in different views. The major technical difficulty of this synthesis comes from the inconsistency of two skeletons. Our algorithm is formulated under the constrained optimization framework by using the bone-lengths as hard constraints and the tradeoff between inconsistent joint positions as soft constraints. Schemes are developed to detect and re-position the problematic joints generated by per-frame method from duplex Kinects. As a result, we develop an easy, cheap and fast approach that can improve the skeleton of human motion at an average speed of 5ms per frame.<p></p></tr></table><BR><BR>

In addition, the input polygonal models need to be manifold and water-tight; otherwise the built objects may have defects or the building process may fail in some cases. In this paper, a regulation method of an arbitrarily complex polygonal model is presented for rapid prototyping and manufacturing applications. The method is based on a semi-implicit representation of a solid model named the Layered Depth-Normal Images (LDNI), which sparsely encodes the shape boundary of a polygonal model in three orthogonal directions. In the method, input polygonal models or parametric equations are first converted into LDNI models.  A regulation operator based on the computed LDNI models is presented.  A volume tiling technique is developed for very complex geometries and high accuracy requirements. From the processed LDNI model, an adaptive contouring method is presented to construct a cell representation that includes both uniform and octree cells.  Finally, two-manifold and water-tight polygonal mesh surfaces are constructed from the cell representation.  The LDNI-based mesh regulation operation can be robust due to its simplicity.  The accuracy of the generated regulated models can be controlled by setting LDNI pixel width. Parallel computing techniques can be employed to accelerate the computation in the LDNI-based method.  Experimental results on various CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach for complex geometries. <p></p></tr></table><BR><BR>

We present a robust and efficient approach to directly slicing implicit solids. 
Different from prior slicing techniques that reconstruct contours on the slicing

we generate contours through a topology guaranteed contour extraction on binary images 
sampled from given solids and a subsequent contour simplification algorithm which 
has the topology preserved and the geometric error controlled. The resultant contours are free of self-intersection, topologically faithful to the given <I>r</I>-regular solids and with shape error bounded; therefore, correct objects can be fabricated from them by rapid prototyping. Moreover, since we do not need to generate the tessellated B-rep of given solids, our approach is memory efficient - only the binary image and the finest contours on one particular slicing plane need to be stored in-core. Our method is general and can be applied to any implicit representations of solids.<p></p></tr></table><BR><BR>

We present an efficient algorithm to extract the manifold surface that approximates the boundary of a solid represented by a <I>Binary Space Partition</I> (BSP) tree. Our polygonization algorithm repeatedly performs clipping operations on volumetric cells that correspond to a spatial convex partition and computes the boundary by traversing the connected cells. We use point-based representations along with finite-precision arithmetic to improve the efficiency and generate the B-rep approximation of a BSP solid. The core of our polygonization method is a novel clipping algorithm that uses a set of logical operations to make it resistant to degeneracies resulting from limited precision of floating-point arithmetic. The overall BSP to B-rep conversion algorithm can accurately generate boundaries with sharp and small features, and is faster than prior methods. At the end of this paper, we use this algorithm for a few geometric processing applications including Boolean operations, model repair and mesh reconstruction.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to construct common base domains for cross-parameterization constrained by anchor points. Based on the common base domains, a bijective mapping between given models can be established. Experimental results show that the distortion in a cross-parameterization generated on our common base domains is much smaller than that of a mapping on domains constructed by prior methods. Different from prior algorithms that generate domains by a heuristic of having higher priority to link the shortest paths between anchor points, we compute the surface Voronoi diagram of anchor points to find out the initial connectivity for the base domains. The final common base domains can be efficiently generated from the initial connectivity. The Voronoi diagram of the anchor points gives better cues than the heuristic of connecting shortest paths greedily, therefore resulting in an efficient and reliable algorithm for construction of common base domains that bring to low distortion in constrained cross-parameterization.<p></p></

<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B><BR>We provide a flexible shape control technique in this paper for the
automatic resizing of apparel products. The automatic resizing
function has become an essential part of the 3D garment CAD systems
to generate user customized apparel products for individuals with
variant body shapes. The human bodies are usually represented by
piecewise linear mesh surfaces with consistent connectivity. The
shape of apparel products can then be warped from the space around a
 human body to the space around another body by computing the new
positions of points on apparel products. However, one major
limitation of this kind of automatic resizing technique is that the
apparel products are always distorted along the shape of the human
bodies. This is a required deformation for tight clothes but not an
expected result for other types of clothes. To solve this problem,
we investigate a method to preserve the shape of user defined
features on the apparel products. As the apparel products are often
represented by discrete surfaces with non-manifold entities, the
existing mesh processing approaches that preserve the local shape
cannot be applied here. A new algorithm consisting of three steps is
developed in this paper. Firstly, the apparel product is warped from
the reference human body to the space around the target human body.
Secondly, the shape of features is optimized to match their original
shape before the warping. Lastly, discrete surfaces of the apparel
product are deformed again under an optimization framework to match
their original shapes locally while interpolating the shape of
features determined in the previous step.<p></p></tr>

The feature points are very important to the establishment of volumetric parameterization around human bodies for the human-centered customization of soft-products [Wang et al., 2007]. For a given template human model with a set of predefined feature points, we first down-sample the input model into a set of sample points.Then, the corresponding points of these samples on the human model are identified by minimizing the distortion with the help of a series of transformations regardless of their differences in postures, scales or positions. The basic idea of our algorithm is to transform the template human body to the shape of the input model iteratively. To generate a bending invariant mapping, the initial correspondence/transformation is computed in a <I>multi-dimensional scaling</I> (MDS) embedding domain of 3D human models, where the Euclidean distance between two samples on a 3D model in the MDS domain corresponds to the geodesic distance between them in R&sup3. As the posture change (i.e., the body bending) of a human model can be considered as approximately isometric in the intrinsic 3D shape, the initial correspondences established in the MDS domain can greatly enhance the robustness of our approach in body bending. Once the correspondences between the surface samples on the template model and the input model are determined after iterative transformations, we have essentially found the corresponding feature points on the input model. Lastly, the locations of the feature points on the input model are refined by a curvature map based local matching step.<p></p></tr></table><BR><BR>

This paper presents a parallel approach for mesh surface modeling from multi-material volume data using an extended Ray-rep as an intermediate, where every homogeneous region is enclosed by a set of two-manifold surface meshes on the resultant model. The approach consists of three major algorithms: firstly, an algorithm is developed to convert the given multi-material volumetric data into a Ray-rep for heterogeneous solid; secondly, filtering algorithm is exploited to process the rays of heterogeneous solid in parallel; and lastly, the adaptive mesh surfaces are generated from the ray-rep through a dual-contouring like algorithm. Here the intermediate surfaces between two constituent materials can be directly extracted without building the volumetric mesh, and the manifold topology is preserved on each surface patch. Furthermore, general offset surface can be easily computed in this paradigm by designing a special parallel operator for the rays.<p></p></tr></table><BR><BR>

<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B><BR>A fast offset surface generation approach is presented in this paper to construct intersection-free offset surfaces, which preserve sharp features, from freeform triangular mesh surfaces. The basic spirit of our algorithm is to sample a narrow-band signed distance-field from the input model on a uniform grid and then employ a contouring algorithm to build the resultant offset mesh surface from the signed distance-field. Four filters are conducted to generate the narrow-band signed distance-field around the offset surface in a very efficient way by alleviating computation redundancies in the regions far from the offset surfaces. The resultant mesh surfaces are generated by a modified dual contouring algorithm which relies on accurate intersections between the grid edges and the isosurfaces. A hybrid method is developed to prevent the expensive bisection search in the configurations that the analytical solutions exist. Our modified intersection-free dual contouring algorithm is based on convex-concave analysis, which is more robust and efficient. The quality and performance of our approach are demonstrated with a number of experimental tests on various examples.<BR><BR>(Supplementary Technical Report - "Intersection-free dual contouring on uniform grids: an approach based on convex/concave analysis" <a href="pubs/TRIntersectionFreeDC.pdf" target="new">[PDF]</a>)<p></p></tr></table><BR><BR>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
Surface flattening has numerous applications in sheet manufacturing industries, such as garment industry, shoe industry, toy industry,furniture industry and ship industry. Motivated by the requirements of those industries, WireWarping approach presented in [Wang08] is exploited to generate 2D patterns with invariant length of feature and boundary curves. However, strict length constraints on all feature curves sometimes cause large distortions on 2D patterns, especially for those 3D surfaces which are highly non-developable. In this paper, we present a flexible and robust extension of WireWarping by introducing a new type of feature curves named <I>elastic feature</I>, which brings flexibility to shape control of the resultant 2D patterns. On these new feature curves, instead of strictly preserving the exact lengths, only the ranges of their lengths are controlled. To achieve this function, a multi-loop shape control optimization framework is proposed to find the optimized 2D shape among all possible flattening results with different length variations on those elastic feature curves, while the lengths of other feature curves are kept unchanged. Besides, we also present a topology processing algorithm on the network of feature curves to eliminate cases that lead to numerical singularity. Experimental results show that the WireWarping++ can successfully flatten surface patches into 2D patterns with more flexible shape control and more robust numerical performance.<p></p></tr></table><BR><BR>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
Uniform offsetting is an important geometric operation for computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications such as rapid prototyping, NC machining, coordinate measuring machines, robot collision avoidance, and Hausdorff error calculation. We present a novel method for offsetting (grown and shrunk) a solid model by an arbitrary distance <I>r</I>. First, offset polygons are directly computed for each face, edge, and vertex of an input solid model. The computed polygonal meshes form a continuous boundary; however, such boundary is invalid since there exist meshes that are closer to the original model than the given distance <I>r</I> as well as self-intersections. Based on the problematic polygonal meshes, we construct a well-structured point-based model, <I>Layered Depth-Normal Images</I> (LDNI), in three orthogonal directions. The accuracy of the generated point-based model can be controlled by setting the tessellation and sampling rates during the construction process. We then process all the sampling points in the model by using a set of point filters to delete all the invalid points. Based on the remaining points, we construct a 2-manifold polygonal contour as the resulted offset boundary. Our method is general, simple and efficient. We report experimental results on a variety of CAD models and discuss various applications of the developed uniform offsetting method.<p></p></tr></table>

<B>Abstract</B>
<BR>
<I>Additive manufacturing</I> (AM) is poised to bring about a revolution in the way products are designed, 
manufactured and distributed to end users. This technology has gained significant academic as well as 
industry interest due to its ability to create complex geometries with customizable material properties.  
AM has also inspired the development of the maker movement by democratizing design and manufacturing. 
Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a 
comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices. 
These challenges are compounded by the fact that advancements in multiple technologies (for example 
materials processing, topology optimization) generate a "positive feedback loop" effect in advancing AM. 
In order to advance research interest and investment in AM technologies, some fundamental questions and 
trends about the dependencies existing in these avenues need highlighting. The goal of our review paper is 
to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings and future trends 
significantly to the researchers. We also discuss fundamental attributes of AM processes, evolution of the 
AM industry, and the affordances enabled by the emergence of AM in a variety of areas such as geometry 
processing, material design and education. We conclude our paper by pointing out future directions such 
as the "print-it-all" paradigm, that have the potential to re-imagine current research and spawn completely 
new avenues for exploration.
